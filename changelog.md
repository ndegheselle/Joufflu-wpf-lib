# Version 0.6.5

- Give the text inputs — `TextBox`, `PasswordBox` and `FormatTextBox` — their own `Dimensions.InputPadding` keys (`Xs`/`Sm`/`Md`/`Lg`), half the control padding's horizontal so they read tighter than a button, covering every size variant where the base text input padding used to be fixed whatever the size. Set on a plain `Padding` setter, so a consumer local value or style overrides it; the theme customizer keeps them in lockstep with the control padding rather than editing them on their own
- Replace `Derive.BorderSides`, `Derive.MarginSides` and `Derive.Corners` by `Derive.BorderThicknessFactor`, `Derive.MarginFactor` and `Derive.CornerRadiusFactor` : a `Thickness` or a `CornerRadius` multiplying the derived value side by side, so `0` still drops a side and `1` keeps it, while any other value scales it — a doubled margin or a halved radius no longer needs its own dimension. Drops the `ThicknessSides` and `Corners` flags enums
- Let the header of a `TreeViewItem` fill the width of the row it is highlighted on, so what is seen as the item is what answers to the mouse — a drag from a `DragSource` in the item template included. Its height follows `VerticalContentAlignment`, still centered by default : a header covering the row entirely sets it to `Stretch` and centers its own content

# Version 0.6.3

- Pass a `DropData` to `DropTarget.Command` rather than the bare `IDataObject` : it is an `IDataObject` of the dragged data, so the commands taking one keep working, and it adds where the pointer is (`Position`) on the element the drop landed on (`Target`), for the targets placing what they receive
- Offer the data wrapped by `DragSource.Data` under the base classes and the interfaces of its type too, so a target can ask for what the data is instead of having to know the exact kind it is given

# Version 0.5.1

- Add a standard confirm overlay, `IOverlayService.Confirm`, with an `EnumConfirmationType` colouring its confirm button
- Add `DropTarget.Command`, turning any element into a drop target
- Add `DragSource.Data`, turning any element into a drag source, with `DragSource.AllowedEffects` and `DragSource.IsDragging`
- Add a `FullContainer` to simplify content placement when using `AllowContentOverTitleBar`
- Support `Paging` without a known total
- Move `Dropdown` from `Joufflu.Navigation` to `Joufflu.Inputs` (namespace `Joufflu.Inputs.Controls`)
- Turn `Dropdown` from a wrapper control into attached properties (`Dropdown.Popup`, `Dropdown.Placement`, `Dropdown.PopupStyle`, offsets) set on a `ToggleButton` you own, so the button accepts any `ToggleButton` style and attached property — `Sizing.IsSquare` included — with nothing to forward. Replaces `Header`, `ButtonStyle` and `PopupPlacement`. Adds `Dropdown.CloseOnClick`, dismissing the popup when a button inside it is clicked. `Dropdown.PopupStyle` now styles the `DropdownPopupHost` drawing the popup chrome, so its padding, background, border and radius are reachable — a `Popup` itself has none of those
- Remove the `Dimensions.BorderThicknessRight` key, now owned by `NavigationMenu` which was its only user
- Add the `Derive.BorderThickness` and `Derive.CornerRadius` attached properties, deriving per-side thicknesses and per-corner radii from a scalar dimension so they follow a runtime theme change
- Derive the partial borders and radii of `NavigationMenu`, `TabControl`, `GroupBox`, `DataGrid` and `ListView` through `Derive`, dropping the `NavigationMenuBorderThickness` key

# Version 0.4.0

- Change the navigation to use types instead of string keys
- Split `OverlayContainer` into separate overlay and `ToastContainer` containers
- Move the tooltip into the `Joufflu` core package

# Version 0.2.0

- Add the `Joufflu.FileExplorer` package : `Explorer`, `ExplorerList`, `ExplorerTree` and `ExplorerControlBar` sharing an `IExplorerSource`, with node visuals and context menus keyed on the node type, drag and drop, keyboard shortcuts, and file operations handed over to the Windows shell
- Add the `xl` control size and its `ControlFontSizeXl` dimension
- Size `FontIcon` from the design system instead of a fixed value
- Improve the toasts look, with a progress bar of their remaining duration
- Restyle the native `ListView` and `TreeView` (rounded border, centered cell content)
- Add `MoreVisualTreeHelper.FindSelfOrParent`, and a logical tree fallback to its parent lookup

# Version 0.1.2

- Move `Badge`, `Spinner`, toasts and the tooltip attached properties out of the core `Joufflu` package into a new `Joufflu.Feedback` package (namespace `Joufflu.Feedback.Controls`)

# Version 0.1.1

- Add tooltip
- Add soft and outline button styles
- Improve theme manager custom themes handling
- Improve `ThemedWindow` handling of `AllowContentOverTitleBar`
